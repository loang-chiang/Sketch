# Sketch!

## Overview
Sketch! is a simple web application that allows the user to create pixel art pieces. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Due to the large size of the canvas, this app is better enjoyed on desktop.

The three main tools of the program are the following:
* **Paint**: You can choose between red, blue, yellow, green, black, pink, orange, and purple for your paintbrush! There are also three paintbrush sizes available: small (paints a 1x1 area), medium (paints a 3x3 area), and large (paints a 5x5 area).

* **Erase**: To get rid of any imperfections in your creations. Same as the paintbrush, you can choose between three eraser sizes: small (1x1), medium (3x3), and large (5x5).

* **New Canvas**: Once you are ready to move on to a new piece, you can click this button and it will automatically clean your previous work and leave you with a blank slate! Each canvas is a 64x64 square grid.

## File-by-file Description
* `index.html`: Where the HTML for the app is stored. This is a one page only program, so there are no other HTML files.

* `script.js`: Where my JavaScript can be found. Handles all the user inputs, including painting, erasing, and generating a new canvas.

* `styles.css`: Where the CSS styling is, divided between in the following three categories: canvas, toolbox, and other.

* `background.jpg`: The image used for the background of the website. It's a free to use picture from Unsplash.

* `README.md`: The file you're reading right now! Hope you enjoy this little project and have fun creating your very own pixel art :)
